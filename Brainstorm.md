# Brainstorm



## Possible strategies

After Christian's talk, trainees got together to figure out options for building a flat light sensor.

Here is a list of options:

1. PIctures of the sky, with or without sun tracking-algorithm
   1. A phone app, citizen science: take picture of sun/sky/ground or even people's shadows, submit to site
2. Pictures of scenery, analyze contrast from shadows
   1. Not standard landscape, will change with snow, weather, wind, location
3. Pictures of shadows of *standards*: rods? others? people?
   1. sideways
   2. downward
4. Polarization looking up or down with optical fibres?
5. Put a cylinder that is hollow, look at shadow with array of detectors inside cylinder
6. Ratio of scalar irradiance and planar irradiance should yield a ratio that is related(?) to *flatness*
7. Shack hartman every point will focus straight if not directional, big spot if flatlight
8. Sense illumination with a dome of sensors aiming at different directions with low acceptance angles

## Things to remember

1. Snow texture will affect the measurements

   1. We want to measure the snow directly 

2. Standards?

3. Realtime analysis/transmission required for use

   



## Things we want to know

1. Snow coverage of devices? 
2. Fog on lenses?
3. Thermal expansion of lenses
4. Temperature of computers? Lenses?
