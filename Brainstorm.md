# Brainstorm



## Possible strategies

After Christian's talk, trainees got together to figure out options for building a flat light sensor.

Here is a list of options:

1. PIctures of the sky, sun tracking-algorithm
   1. phone App, citizen science take picture of sun/sky/ground or even their shadows
2. Pictures of scenery, analyze contrast
3. Pictures of shadows of *standards*: rods? others? people?
   1. sideways
   2. downward
4. Polarization looking up or down with optical fibres?
5. Put a cylinder that is hollow, look at shadow with array of detectors inside cylinder
6. Ratio of scalar irradiance and planar irradiance should yield a ratio that is related to *flatness*
7. Shack hartman every point will focus straight if not directional, big spot if flatlight
8. Sense illumination with a dome of sensors aiming at different directions with low acceptance angles



## Things to remember

1. Snow texture will affect the measurements
   1. We want to measure directly the snow
2. 



## Things we want to know

1. Snow coverage of devices? 
2. Fog on lenses?
3.
